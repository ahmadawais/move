# Optional, free, one time per Mac: creates a self-signed code-signing certificate "Move Local Signing" in your
# login keychain. scripts/build.sh then signs with it, so the signature is the same on every rebuild and macOS
# keeps Move's Accessibility permission. Without it Move is signed ad-hoc and works the same, but you re-allow
# Accessibility after each rebuild. No Apple Developer account ($99) involved.
#
# The private key is created here and never leaves your login keychain; only /usr/bin/codesign may use it.
# macOS asks for your login password once (here, or a "codesign wants to access key" dialog → Always Allow).
# Exit 0: created. Exit 10: already there.
